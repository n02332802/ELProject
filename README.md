RPi project - Create a responsive website with temperature data using Node.js, a database, and Angular.js
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**0.** 
- Set up RPi with 8GB memory card. Installed Raspbian.

**1.** 
- Installed and set up Node.js following this tutorial:
	- http://blog.rueedlinger.ch/2013/03/raspberry-pi-and-nodejs-basic-setup/
	- Then went through a node.js tutorial: http://www.nodebeginner.org/
	
**2.**
- Built and installed MongoDB. It took ~9 hours total!
	- http://mongopi.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/installation/
- Created a database to test MongoDB. Had to make sure to run 'mongod' in the background.
	
**2a.** 
-Installed mongoose to connect  MongoDB to Node.js.
	- http://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html
	- http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html
	- http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html

**2b.** 
- Expanded my server program to create a database with 1 entry to test.
- Currently having problems. The module can not be found. I might have installed in the wrong directory.
- Maybe I can just change the path in my code. Maybe I'll just pick another database. 
	
**3.** 
- Installed SQLite 
- Installed DBLITE with 'npm install dblite' in the project's directory.
   - https://github.com/WebReflection/dblite/
   
**4.** 
- Used zetcode.com/db/sqlite/ documentation to create a database from a .csv file.
- Had to delete the title line.
   
**5.** 
- Used	'npm install node-highcharts' to install the node module for highcharts.
	- Used https://npmjs.org/package/node-highcharts to start.
- Currently using http://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/preprocessing-live-data to figure out how to graph live data.
   
**CODE:** 
- Start server using command 'node index.js'. index.js sets up handles and starts the server 
located in server.js. 
- server.js recieves the router module and the handle array as parameters and 
uses them to parse the URL and use the correct function in requestHandler.js. 
- The printDB function
in requestHandler.js creates a table, deletes anything in it, enters the .csv's data into it and then
prints the contents of the database out in a table. 
- Currently working towards a live graph.
